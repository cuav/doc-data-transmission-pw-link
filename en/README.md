### PW-Link Product Summary

---

At present, PW-Link data transmission module is divided into ** built-in antenna** and **external antenna** version. The built-in antenna version is only suitable for various calibration and adjustment parameters of the **PIX flight control ** close range, and the actual transmission distance of the external antenna version after many practical tests is **450** meters. Using the computer ground station Mission Planner for long-term connection tests, the average stability of the data transmission signal is maintained at more than **90%**. Due to its small size**, long distance**, stable data**, and easy-to-connect** features, it is ideally suited for digital receivers within a few hundred meters of a small drone.
